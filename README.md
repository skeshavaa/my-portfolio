## About

This is probably the 5th edition of this website. Each time I've rebuilt it it's become better and better. The first time being
just two files of pure HTML and CSS. And this website being a full MERN stack web app deployed on Heroku. This website serves as my personal portfolio website containing my resume, skills, experience and a contact me form. I wanted to create a simple UI that users would like and find easy to navigate.

## Stack

* React
* Express JS
* MongoDB
* Node JS
* Material-UI
